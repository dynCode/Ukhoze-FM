        <strong>9. SHARING OF INSURANCE INFORMATION </strong><br />
        Insurers share information with each other regarding policies and claims with a view to prevent fraudulent claims and obtain material information regarding the assessment of risks proposed for insurance.  By reducing the incidents of fraud and assessing risks fairly, future premium increases may be limited.  This is done in the public interest and in the interest of all current and potential policyholders.<br />
        The sharing of information includes, but is not limited to information sharing via the Information Data Sharing System operated by TransUnion ITC on behalf of the South African Insurance Association.  By the insurer accepting or renewing this insurance, you or any other person that is represented herein, gives consent to the said information being disclosed to any other insurance company or its agent.<br />
        <br />
        You also similarly give consent to the sharing of information in regards to past insurance policies and claims that you have made.  You also acknowledge that information provided by yourself or your representative may be verified against any legally recognised sources or databases.<br />
        By insuring or renewing your insurance you hereby not only consent to such information sharing, but also waive any rights of confidentiality with regards to underwriting or claims information that you have provided or that has been provided by another person on your behalf.<br />
        In the event of a claim, the information you have supplied with your application together with the information you supply in relation to the claim, will be included on the system and made available to other insurers participating in the Information Data Sharing System.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>10. USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br />
        When you enter into this policy you will be giving us your personal information that may be protected by data protections legislation, including but not only, the Protection of Personal Information Act, 2013 (“POPI”).
